# Holberton School Interview Preparation

This repository is designed for interview preparation at Holberton School, covering a range of algorithmic and problem-solving tasks in various sub-project directories. Each sub-project tackles a unique challenge, testing different aspects of programming, logic, and efficiency.

## Directory Structure

- `0x00-pascal_triangle`: Contains code to generate Pascal's Triangle, a classic mathematical structure useful in combinatorics.
- `0x01-lockboxes`: Solves a problem on determining whether all boxes in a set can be opened given certain keys in each box.
- `0x02-minimum_operations`: Implements a function that calculates the minimum operations needed to reach a target number of characters, given only "copy all" and "paste" operations.
- `0x03-log_parsing`: Parses logs to track and manage various system requests, ensuring resource monitoring and request counting.
- `0x04-utf8_validation`: Validates a sequence of bytes to determine if it is a valid UTF-8 encoding, used in text processing and encoding checks.
- `0x05-nqueens`: Solves the famous N-Queens puzzle, which requires placing N queens on an N x N chessboard without any queen threatening another.
- `0x07-rotate_2d_matrix`: Rotates a given 2D matrix 90 degrees clockwise, useful in image processing and spatial transformations.
- `0x08-making_change`: Implements a coin change solution to determine the minimum number of coins needed to make a target amount.
- `0x09-island_perimeter`: Calculates the perimeter of an island represented on a grid, useful in geographical or grid-based simulations.
- `0x0A-primegame`: Implements a game based on prime numbers, where players take turns choosing numbers, focusing on optimizing strategy with prime counts.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Each project is implemented in Python. You need Python 3.x installed on your system to run the code.

### Installation

Clone the repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/holbertonschool-interviews.git
cd holbertonschool-interviews

## Running Code
Each directory contains Python files and test cases. Navigate to the project folder to execute the main script and view results.

For example, to run `0x02-minimum_operations`:

```bash
cd 0x02-minimum_operations
python3 0-main.py
